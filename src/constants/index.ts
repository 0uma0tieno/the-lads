    detailedDescription: 'This project involved building a quadcopter from scratch and equipping it with a custom gimbal for a multispectral camera. The core challenge was developing a real-time image processing pipeline on a Raspberry Pi using OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite. The drone autonomously navigates pre-defined GPS waypoints, captures images, and uses a trained CNN model to detect signs of nutrient deficiency and pest infestation, providing farmers with actionable data to improve crop yield and reduce waste.',
